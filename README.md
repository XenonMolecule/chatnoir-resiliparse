## About this fork

This fork develops a **Rust main-content extractor** (`resiliparse._extract_rs`)
that substantially outperforms upstream resiliparse's extraction quality while
staying fast (~3 ms/doc markdown extraction, single-threaded). All quality work
is documented as numbered research cycles in [`research_log/`](research_log/)
(180 cycles: every change ships with a full regression battery, and negative
results are logged alongside wins).

**Headline results** — full tables, per-metric breakdowns, sources and caveats
in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md):

| Benchmark | This fork | Upstream resiliparse | Best other extractor |
|---|---|---|---|
| marin devset (token F1) | **0.9050** | 0.8880 | Dripper 0.8943 |
| WebMainBench en/dev (token F1) | **0.8633** | 0.8309 | trafilatura 0.8073 |
| WebMainBench fine-grained (overall) | **0.6150** | 0.2352 | Dripper 0.5852 |
| Zyte article benchmark (token F1) | 0.8899 | 0.8806 | **trafilatura 0.9520** |
| trafilatura eval set (F1) | 0.8421 | 0.8104 | **Dripper 0.9335** |
| Extraction unit tests | **97/100** | 90/100 | — |

We lead the broad-web benchmarks (marin, WebMainBench) and beat upstream
resiliparse everywhere, but place third on the two article-centric sets, where
trafilatura and Dripper cut boilerplate harder. Our recall is the highest or
near-highest on every benchmark; precision is the weak side. Per-benchmark
tables with all five extractors: [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md).

Domain-focused sets (code / math / science / tables) are audited for content
fidelity: code blocks, LaTeX, and table structure are preserved (GFM tables
parse; upstream emits none), and measured failure modes are additive chrome,
not content loss. Extraction runs on raw HTML without executing JavaScript,
so content that exists only in hydration state is out of reach — see the
known-limitation section of [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md#6-known-limitation-javascript-hydrated-pages).

### Quick start

Needs Rust, vcpkg (`VCPKG_ROOT` set), cmake, libclang, and Python 3.11+.
Full notes and troubleshooting: [`INSTALL_RUST_EXTRACTOR.md`](INSTALL_RUST_EXTRACTOR.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XenonMolecule/chatnoir-resiliparse.git
cd chatnoir-resiliparse
export VCPKG_ROOT="$HOME/vcpkg"

# 1. build the Rust extractor (~1 min: vcpkg compiles lexbor)
cargo build --release -p resiliparse-extract-rs

# 2. link the extension module (gitignored, so a fresh clone must create it)
#    Linux: swap .dylib for .so
ln -sf "$(pwd)/target/release/libresiliparse_extract_rs.dylib" \
       resiliparse-py/resiliparse/_extract_rs.so

# 3. put the Python package on the path
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/resiliparse-py:$PYTHONPATH"
```

```python
from resiliparse._extract_rs import extract_plain_text

text = extract_plain_text(html, main_content=True, preserve_formatting='markdown')
```

⚠️ `resiliparse.extract.html2text` is **upstream's Cython engine**, not this one —
the results above come from `resiliparse._extract_rs` only.

**Evaluation harness:** `benchmark/eval/run_eval.py` (per-doc ROUGE-L /
Levenshtein scoring with regression batteries); external benchmarks under
`benchmark/external/`. The autonomous-research process itself is described in
[`AUTORESEARCH.md`](AUTORESEARCH.md), with the open work queue in
[`research_log/QUEUE.md`](research_log/QUEUE.md).

Everything below this line is upstream's original README.

## Usage Instructions

For detailed information about the build process, dependencies, APIs, or usage instructions, please read
the [Resiliparse Documentation](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/index.html)

## Resiliparse Module Summary

The Resiliparse collection encompasses the following two modules at the moment:

### 1. Resiliparse

The Resiliparse main module with the following subcomponents:

#### Parsing Utilities

The Resiliparse Parsing Utilities are highly optimized tools for dealing with encodings, detecting content types of raw
protocol payloads, parsing HTML web pages, performing language detection, and more.

Main documentation: [Resiliparse Parsing Utilities](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/parse.html)

#### Extraction Utilities

The Resiliparse Extraction Utilities are a set of performance-optimized and highly efficient tools for extracting
structural or semantic information from noisy raw web data for further processing, such as (main) content extraction /
boilerplate removal, schema extraction, general web data cleansing, and more.

Main documentation: [Resiliparse Extraction Utilities](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/extract.html)

#### Process Guards

The Resiliparse Process Guard module is a set of decorators and context managers for guarding a processing context to
stay within pre-defined limits for execution time and memory usage. Process Guards help to ensure the (partially)
successful completion of batch processing jobs in which individual tasks may time out or use abnormal amounts of memory,
but in which the success of the whole job is not threatened by (a few) individual failures. A guarded processing context
will be interrupted upon exceeding its resource limits so that the task can be skipped or rescheduled.

Main documentation: [Resiliparse Process Guards](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/process-guard.html)

#### Itertools

Resiliparse Itertools are a collection of convenient and robust helper functions for iterating over data from unreliable
sources using other tools from the Resiliparse toolkit.

Main documentation: [Resiliparse Itertools](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/itertools.html)

### 2. FastWARC

FastWARC is a high-performance WARC parsing library for Python written in Rust with bindings for Python.
compressed and uncompressed WARC/1.0 and WARC/1.1 streams. Supported compression algorithms are GZip, Zstd, and LZ4.

Main documentation: [FastWARC](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/fastwarc.html)
and [FastWARC CLI](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/fastwarc-cli.html)

## Installation (Rust)

To use FastWARC as a library in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fastwarc = "*" # Specify the correct version here
```

Then build your project like normal with `cargo build`.

Resiliparse is not yet available as a stable crate.

## Installation (Python)

Pre-built wheels are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows on PyPi, which can be installed via `pip`:

Resiliparse:

```bash
pip install resiliparse
```

FastWARC:

```bash
pip install fastwarc
```

### Building Bindings From Source

You can also build the Resiliparse and FastWARC Python bindings yourself from source. FastWARC has been fully ported to
Rust. Resiliparse is still written in Cython.

For detailed build instructions, please refer to
the [build documentation](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/stable/man/installation.html) or the individual READMEs:

- [Resiliparse](resiliparse-py/README.md)
- [FastWARC](fastwarc-py/README.md)
